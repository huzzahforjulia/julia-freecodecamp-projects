Here's where I store all my freecodecamp projects.

What is freecodecamp?
----
[freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is currently my favourite place to learn code. Each course ends with a series of 5 projects.

Here is my personal [freecodecamp profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/huzzahforjulia) if you'd like to see which courses I've completed, and here is my [CodePen profile](https://codepen.io/huzzahforjulia), where my projects are hosted.

So far, I have completed the certificates for [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/huzzahforjulia/responsive-web-design) and [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/huzzahforjulia/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures)!
